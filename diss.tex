%% The ubcdiss class provides several options:
%%   fogscopy
%%       set parameters to exactly how FoGS specifies
%%         * single-sided
%%         * page-numbering starts from title page
%%         * the lists of figures and tables have each entry prefixed
%%           with 'Figure' or 'Table'
%%       This can be tested by `\iffogscopy ... \else ... \fi'
%%   10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%%       set default font size
%%   oneside, twoside
%%       whether to format for single-sided or double-sided printing
%%   balanced
%%       when double-sided, ensure page content is centred
%%       rather than slightly offset (the default)
%%   singlespacing, onehalfspacing, doublespacing
%%       set default inter-line text spacing; the ubcdiss class
%%       provides \textspacing to revert to this configured spacing
%%   draft
%%       disable more intensive processing, such as including
%%       graphics, etc.

%% HYPERREF:
%% The hyperref package provides for embedding hyperlinks into your
%% document.  By default the table of contents, references, citations,
%% and footnotes are hyperlinked.
%%
%% Hyperref provides a very handy command for doing cross-references:
%% \autoref{}.  This is similar to \ref{} and \pageref{} except that
%% it automagically puts in the *type* of reference.  For example,
%% referencing a figure's label will put the text `Figure 3.4'.
%% And the text will be hyperlinked to the appropriate place in the
%% document.
%%
%% Generally hyperref should appear after most other packages
 
%% The following puts hyperlinks in very faint grey boxes.
%% The `pagebackref' causes the references in the bibliography to have
%% back-references to the citing page; `backref' puts the citing section
%% number.  See further below for other examples of using hyperref.
%% 2009/12/09: now use `linktocpage' (Jacek Kisynski): FoGS now prefers
%%   that the ToC, LoF, LoT place the hyperlink on the page number,
%%   rather than the entry text.
