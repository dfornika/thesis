\chapter*{Additional Information}
This chapter shows you how to include additional information in your
thesis, the removal of which will not affect the submission.  Such
material should be removed before the thesis is actually submitted.

First, the chapter is unnumbered and not included in the Table of
Contents.  Second, it is the last section of the thesis, so its
removal will not alter any of the page numbering etc. for the previous
sections.  Do not include any floats, however, as these will appear in
the initial lists.

The \texttt{ubcthesis} \LaTeX{} class has been designed to aid you in
producing a thesis that conforms to the requirements of The
University of British Columbia Faculty of Graduate Studies (FoGS).

Proper use of this class and sample is highly recommended---and should
produce a well formatted document that meets the FoGS requirement.
Notwithstanding, complex theses may require additional formatting that
may conflict with some of the requirements.  We therefore \emph{highly
  recommend} that you consult one of the FoGS staff for assistance and
an assessment of potential problems \emph{before} starting final
draft.

While we have attemped to address most of the thesis formatting
requirements in these files, they do not constitute an official set of
thesis requirements.  The official requirements are available at the
following section of the FoGS web site:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|}
    \hline
    \href{http://www.grad.ubc.ca/students/thesis/}
    {\texttt{http://www.grad.ubc.ca/students/thesis/}}\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
We recommend that you review these instructions carefully.
