\chapter{Preface}

Funding for these experiments was obtained from \ac{CIHR} by Angela Brooks-Wilson, in collaboration with the Marco Marra, Joseph Connors, Stephen Jones, Nhu Le and Graydon Meneilly.  The experiments described in this thesis are a part of the Genomics, Genetics and Gerontology (G\textsuperscript{3}) Study of Healthy Aging.

All experiments were concieved of and designed by Angela Brooks-Wilson.  This thesis is broadly composed of three sub-experiments.  They are: pooled next-generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA, Sanger sequencing of individual mitochondrial control-regions, and determination of mitochondrial genotypes by Sequenom genotyping.

Dan Fornika performed the \ac{PCR} reactions necessary to provide template mitochondrial DNA for both pooled mitochondrial DNA sequencing and control-region Sanger sequencing.  Mitochondrial DNA pools were constructed by Dan Fornika.

Sanger sequencing was prepared by Julius Halaschek-Wiener with assistance from Dan Fornika.  Sanger sequencing was performed by the sequencing group of the \ac{BCGSC}.

Library construction and Illumina \ac{GA} sequencing was performed by the sequencing group of the \ac{BCGSC}.

Sequenom genotyping was performed by the McGill University/Genome Qu\'{e}bec Innovation Centre.

All bioinformatics and statistical analyses were performed by Dan Fornika, except for quality control of Sequenom genotype data, which was performed by Denise Daley.
